2. Start Coding

This repository demonstrates a backend architecture that handles asynchronous tasks, workflows, and job execution using TypeScript, Express.js, and TypeORM. The project showcases how to:

- Define and manage entities such as `Task` and `Workflow`.
- Use a `WorkflowFactory` to create workflows from YAML configurations.
- Implement a `TaskRunner` that executes jobs associated with tasks and manages task and workflow states.
- Run tasks asynchronously using a background worker.

## Key Features

1. **Entity Modeling with TypeORM**

   - **Task Entity:** Represents an individual unit of work with attributes like `taskType`, `status`, `progress`, and references to a `Workflow`.
   - **Workflow Entity:** Groups multiple tasks into a defined sequence or steps, allowing complex multi-step processes.

2. **Workflow Creation from YAML**

   - Use `WorkflowFactory` to load workflow definitions from a YAML file.
   - Dynamically create workflows and tasks without code changes by updating YAML files.

3. **Asynchronous Task Execution**

   - A background worker (`taskWorker`) continuously polls for `queued` tasks.
   - The `TaskRunner` runs the appropriate job based on a task’s `taskType`.

4. **Robust Status Management**

   - `TaskRunner` updates the status of tasks (from `queued` to `in_progress`, `completed`, or `failed`).
   - Workflow status is evaluated after each task completes, ensuring you know when the entire workflow is `completed` or `failed`.

5. **Dependency Injection and Decoupling**
   - `TaskRunner` takes in only the `Task` and determines the correct job internally.
   - `TaskRunner` handles task state transitions, leaving the background worker clean and focused on orchestration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm or yarn
- SQLite or another supported database

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/backend-coding-challenge.git
   cd backend-coding-challenge
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure TypeORM:**

   - Edit `data-source.ts` to ensure the `entities` array includes `Task` and `Workflow` entities.
   - Confirm database settings (e.g. SQLite file path).

4. **Create or Update the Workflow YAML:**
   - Place a YAML file (e.g. `example_workflow.yml`) in a `workflows/` directory.
   - Define steps, for example:
     ```yaml
     name: "example_workflow"
     steps:
       - taskType: "analysis"
         stepNumber: 1
       - taskType: "notification"
         stepNumber: 2
     ```

### Running the Application

1. **Compile TypeScript (optional if using `ts-node`):**

   ```bash
   npx tsc
   ```

2. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   If using `ts-node`, this will start the Express.js server and the background worker after database initialization.

3. **Create a Workflow (e.g. via `/analysis`):**

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/analysis \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{
    "clientId": "client123",
    "geoJson": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [
            [
                [
                    -63.624885020050996,
                    -10.311050368263523
                ],
                [
                    -63.624885020050996,
                    -10.367865108370523
                ],
                [
                    -63.61278302732815,
                    -10.367865108370523
                ],
                [
                    -63.61278302732815,
                    -10.311050368263523
                ],
                [
                    -63.624885020050996,
                    -10.311050368263523
                ]
            ]
        ]
    }
    }'
   ```

   This will read the configured workflow YAML, create a workflow and tasks, and queue them for processing.

4. **Check Logs:**
   - The worker picks up tasks from `queued` state.
   - `TaskRunner` runs the corresponding job (e.g., data analysis, email notification) and updates states.
   - Once tasks are done, the workflow is marked as `completed`.

### **Coding Challenge Tasks for the Interviewee**

The following tasks must be completed to enhance the backend system:

---

### **1. Add a New Job to Calculate Polygon Area**

**Objective:**  
Create a new job class to calculate the area of a polygon from the GeoJSON provided in the task.

#### **Steps:**

1. Create a new job file `PolygonAreaJob.ts` in the `src/jobs/` directory.
2. Implement the `Job` interface in this new class.
3. Use `@turf/area` to calculate the polygon area from the `geoJson` field in the task.
4. Save the result in the `output` field of the task.

#### **Requirements:**

- The `output` should include the calculated area in square meters.
- Ensure that the job handles invalid GeoJSON gracefully and marks the task as failed.

---

### **2. Add a Job to Generate a Report**

**Objective:**  
Create a new job class to generate a report by aggregating the outputs of multiple tasks in the workflow.

#### **Steps:**

1. Create a new job file `ReportGenerationJob.ts` in the `src/jobs/` directory.
2. Implement the `Job` interface in this new class.
3. Aggregate outputs from all preceding tasks in the workflow into a JSON report. For example:
   ```json
   {
     "workflowId": "<workflow-id>",
     "tasks": [
       { "taskId": "<task-1-id>", "type": "polygonArea", "output": "<area>" },
       {
         "taskId": "<task-2-id>",
         "type": "dataAnalysis",
         "output": "<analysis result>"
       }
     ],
     "finalReport": "Aggregated data and results"
   }
   ```
4. Save the report as the `output` of the `ReportGenerationJob`.

#### **Requirements:**

- Ensure the job runs only after all preceding tasks are complete.
- Handle cases where tasks fail, and include error information in the report.

---

### **3. Support Interdependent Tasks in Workflows**

**Objective:**  
Modify the system to support workflows with tasks that depend on the outputs of earlier tasks.

#### **Steps:**

1. Update the `Task` entity to include a `dependency` field that references another task
2. Modify the `TaskRunner` to wait for dependent tasks to complete and pass their outputs as inputs to the current task.
3. Extend the workflow YAML format to specify task dependencies (e.g., `dependsOn`).
4. Update the `WorkflowFactory` to parse dependencies and create tasks accordingly.

#### **Requirements:**

- Ensure dependent tasks do not execute until their dependencies are completed.
- Test workflows where tasks are chained through dependencies.

---

### **4. Ensure Final Workflow Results Are Properly Saved**

**Objective:**  
Save the aggregated results of all tasks in the workflow as the `finalResult` field of the `Workflow` entity.

#### **Steps:**

1. Modify the `Workflow` entity to include a `finalResult` field:
2. Aggregate the outputs of all tasks in the workflow after the last task completes.
3. Save the aggregated results in the `finalResult` field.

#### **Requirements:**

- The `finalResult` must include outputs from all completed tasks.
- Handle cases where tasks fail, and include failure information in the final result.

---

### **5. Create an Endpoint for Getting Workflow Status**

**Objective:**  
Implement an API endpoint to retrieve the current status of a workflow.

#### **Endpoint Specification:**

- **URL:** `/workflow/:id/status`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Response Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "workflowId": "3433c76d-f226-4c91-afb5-7dfc7accab24",
    "status": "in_progress",
    "completedTasks": 3,
    "totalTasks": 5
  }
  ```

#### **Requirements:**

- Include the number of completed tasks and the total number of tasks in the workflow.
- Return a `404` response if the workflow ID does not exist.

---

### **6. Create an Endpoint for Retrieving Workflow Results**

**Objective:**  
Implement an API endpoint to retrieve the final results of a completed workflow.

#### **Endpoint Specification:**

- **URL:** `/workflow/:id/results`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Response Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "workflowId": "3433c76d-f226-4c91-afb5-7dfc7accab24",
    "status": "completed",
    "finalResult": "Aggregated workflow results go here"
  }
  ```

#### **Requirements:**

- Return the `finalResult` field of the workflow if it is completed.
- Return a `404` response if the workflow ID does not exist.
- Return a `400` response if the workflow is not yet completed.

---

### **Deliverables**

- **Code Implementation:**

  - New jobs: `PolygonAreaJob` and `ReportGenerationJob`.
  - Enhanced workflow support for interdependent tasks.
  - Workflow final results aggregation.
  - New API endpoints for workflow status and results.

- **Documentation:**
  - Update the README file to include instructions for testing the new features.

## Known Limitations / Would Revisit

The items below are deliberate scope choices rather than unknowns. They are documented here because a production deployment would address each one differently — calling them out explicitly so a reviewer can distinguish "didn't notice" from "noticed and scoped out."

### 1. Dependents run on failed dependencies

`TaskRepository.findNextRunnable` treats both `completed` and `failed` as satisfying a dependency, so a downstream task (e.g. `report_generation`) still runs when its upstream dependency failed. The current behavior is a form of graceful degradation: the report aggregates whatever outputs and errors are available, and the eventual `finalResult` still carries the failure information for the dependent's input.

For a production system I would model this as an explicit `skipped` state, propagated from a failed dependency to its dependents at scheduling time, and surface it in `finalResult` rather than silently running the dependent on partial inputs. That makes the "this output is missing because its upstream failed" case legible to API consumers instead of inferring it from `output: null`.

### 2. `report_generation` aggregates all terminal siblings, not its declared dependencies

`runReportGeneration` walks every sibling task in the workflow rather than the task's own `dependencies` array. For the included `example_workflow.yml` this is equivalent — one report node summarizes the whole workflow. A wider DAG with two report nodes, or with unrelated parallel branches that share a workflow, would produce an over-broad summary.

The fix is to walk `task.dependencies` instead of the sibling list. Left scoped here because the example workflow does not exercise the broader shape, and the change would otherwise extend without test coverage for the new behavior.

### 3. Single-worker assumption / non-atomic task pickup

The polling worker uses a plain `SELECT ... WHERE status = 'queued'` followed by an in-process readiness filter, then flips the status to `in_progress` in a separate write inside `TaskWorker.processNext`. Running two workers against the same database would race: both could hydrate the same row and execute the handler twice. The current bootstrap only spawns one worker per process, so this is latent.

For a production system I would either make the claim atomic (`UPDATE tasks SET status = 'in_progress' WHERE id = ? AND status = 'queued'`, gated on affected-row count), or add lease columns (`ownerId`, `lockedUntil`) with a periodic stale-lock sweeper to recover after a crashed worker. The current `requeueInterrupted` boot step covers crashes between process restarts but not concurrent workers.
